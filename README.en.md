This project attempts to implement the McBopomofo input method using JavaScript/TypeScript and web-related technologies. McBopomofo is an automatic character selection Bopomofo input method that provides multiple common keyboard layouts and various convenient features for fast input.

The project directory provides:

- [src](https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofoWeb/tree/main/src): McBopomofo input method core written in TypeScript
- [output/example](https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofoWeb/tree/main/output/example): Example web page
- [output/chromeos](https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofoWeb/tree/main/output/chromeos): Input method for Chrome OS
- [output/pime](https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofoWeb/tree/main/output/pime): Input method for Windows (based on [PIME](https://github.com/EasyIME/PIME) framework)

In addition to the input method, this project also provides the following text conversion services:

- Adding Bopomofo annotations to Chinese characters, including HTML Ruby format
- Converting Chinese characters to Taiwan Braille
- Converting Taiwan Braille to Chinese characters

## Usage

- Web version: Available [here](https://openvanilla.github.io/McBopomofoWeb/)
- Chrome OS version: Please download from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pkjjfjnlglfhgfaipoempeaghmpfakkg)
- PIME version: Currently please compile using Node.js tools and use manually

## Build Instructions

If using npm, please enter the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm run build # Build web version
npm run build:chromeos # Build Chrome OS version
npm run build:pime # Build Windows PIME version
```

These commands will create corresponding files in the output directory, usually called bundle.js.

### Building Example Web Page

After compiling with `npm run build`, directly open output/example/index.html with a browser to see the web version McBopomofo input method functionality demonstration.

### Building and Testing Chrome OS Version

To test the Chrome OS version, you can follow these steps:

- First, compile the bundle.js in the chromeos directory according to the previous instructions.
- You can set up a Node.js development environment on your Chromebook, please refer to the [documentation in the Wiki](https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofoWeb/wiki/Chrome-OS-%E8%BC%B8%E5%85%A5%E6%B3%95%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BC).
- If you are compiling on another personal computer, you can move the entire output/chromeos directory to Google Drive and then sync it to your Chromebook.
- On your Chromebook, or other devices with Chrome OS installed, enter `chrome://extensions`, select "load unpacked", and choose the `chromeos` directory on Google Drive.

### Building and Testing Windows PIME Version

- Please first install [PIME](https://github.com/EasyIME/PIME/releases) on your Windows PC. During installation, please note that you need to check the option to install Node-related input methods. PIME supports both Python and Node input method frameworks, but Node-related input methods are not in the default installation options, while McBopomofo is based on the Node version.
- You can install Node.js environment on your own PC, then execute `npm run build:pime`.
- Copy the files in the output\pime directory to the PIME installation directory, for example `C:\Program Files (x86)\PIME\node\input_methods\mcbopomofo`. You may need administrator privileges.
- Use administrator privileges to execute `regsvr32 "C:\Program Files (X86)\PIME\x86\PIMETextService.dll"` to register the McBopomofo input method in the system.
- After each recompilation, you need to perform the same steps, then remember to restart the PIME service. You can right-click on the PIME Launcher icon in the system tray and select "Restart".
- You can also refer to the content of build_pime.bat.

Debugging: During the development of the PIME version, you can debug through PIME's own Debug Log. You can right-click on the PIME Launcher icon in the Windows system tray to open the right-click menu, where you can see options to open and view logs. Additionally, you can use the following PowerShell command to view real-time logs:

```
set LOG_FILE="%localappdata%\\PIME\Log\\PIMELauncher.log"
set COMMAND="powershell Get-Content -Tail 10 -Wait %LOG_FILE%"
powershell -noexit %COMMAND%
```

## Others

In the others directory, we provide a Word Add-in that facilitates the use of Chinese character to Braille conversion functions in Microsoft Word. Usage is as follows:

```sh
cd others/WordAddin
npm install
npm run start:desktop
```

If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer (Windows or macOS), it will automatically open Word and enable this Add-in in Word. If you want to test in the web version of Word, please refer to Microsoft's documentation [Sideload Office Add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing).

## Third-party Packages

This software uses the following packages:

- [chinese_convert](https://github.com/ccckmit/chinese_convert): Handles simplified-traditional Chinese conversion
- [chrome-storage-largeSync](https://github.com/dtuit/chrome-storage-largeSync): Used to store user dictionaries
